Report
You need to measure the file transmission time for

Different file sizes
Different bandwidths
Different delays
and plot them in three figures. Remember to fix other two parameters while changing one and make your plots reader-friendly. In the report, you need to follow the hypothesis-experiment-conclusion structure:

Hypothesis. Before running experiments, what is your expected results? Why?
Experiment. Measure the file transmission time under different conditions and plot your results.
Conclusion. Does you experiment results match your expectations? What may cause the gap between them? If your predictions are totally different from your resutls, please hypothesize as to why your predictions were wrong.
The following parameter configurations are for your reference. You are free to test with other configurations to verify your hypothesis.

Test 1

Bandwidth = 10Mbps
Delay = 10ms
Filesize = 1KB, 5KB, 25KB, 100KB, 1MB,10MB
To create a file with a desired size:

fallocate -x -l 1M 1M.txt
Test 2

Dealy = 10ms
Filesize = 1MB
Bandwidth = 1Mbps, 5Mbps, 10Mbps, 20Mbps
Test 3

Bandwidth = 10Mbps
Filesize = 1MB
Delay = 0ms, 5ms, 10ms, 20ms, 50ms, 100ms
